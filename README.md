# yeast_hunter

Yeast are found everywhere in the environment! 

The yeast genomes we will be analyzing this semester were sequenced from yeast sampled from weird and wonderful places across the world. 

Maybe our class will even be able to sample later in the semester... 

In the interim, we will virtually sample on the HPC Cluster.

Each of you will have a unique yeast species, so if you find one that has already been claimed on the spreadsheet - keep looking!
